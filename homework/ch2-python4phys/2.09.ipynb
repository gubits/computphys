    "on the other atoms nearby and their locations.  Consider for instance solid\n",
    "sodium chloride---table salt.  The sodium chloride crystal has atoms\n",
    "arranged on a cubic lattice, but with alternating sodium and chlorine\n",
    "atoms, the sodium ones having a single positive charge $+e$ and the\n",
    "chlorine ones a single negative charge $-e$, where $e$ is the charge on the\n",
    "electron. If we label each position on the lattice by three integer\n",
    "coordinates $(i,j,k)$, then the sodium atoms fall at positions where\n",
    "$i+j+k$ is even, and the chlorine atoms at positions where $i+j+k$ is odd.\n",

    "\n",
    "To calculate the Madelung constant of sodium chloride crystal, one simply needs to sum up the potentials of all the atoms surrounding the target atom. Sodium ions are assigned positive potentials, while chloride ions are assigned negative potentials. As the range number $L$ becomes sufficiently large, the sum will approach the theoretical value M from both above and below. When programming, it is important to note that when $i=j=k=0$, which represents the origin, this point should be excluded to avoid the program encountering an error due to division by zero."
